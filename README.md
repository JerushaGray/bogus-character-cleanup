# bogus-character-cleanup
This was created to solve the problem often faced when working with first and last names in spreadsheets (in English) for contacts in european countries. Encoding issues cause unexpected characters to be subbed in - making the data unusuable for upload into crms and other databases. 
This was written in vba for use in spreadsheets in conjunction with a macro editor.
The character list included is not exhaustive.
This represents the most common occuring character encoding issues for German, Swedish, Finish, Norwegian, French, Spanish, and Polish first and last names.
